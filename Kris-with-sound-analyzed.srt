0
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:02,029
Record our call. So I didn't have to do a zoom.

1
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:03,430
OK.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:11,470
OK. So I'm just gonna ask you questions today about Grandpa Ross. So you just answer

3
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:14,289
to the best of your ability.

4
00:00:14,649 --> 00:00:15,489
And

5
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:18,049
if you have actually,

6
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,049
you could answer him for grandma too because I

7
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:23,409
have to for my class type up a life sketch

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,569
for someone and put it on

9
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,809
um family search.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,409
So their first

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,180
their full names,

12
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,049
Ross Olsen

13
00:00:35,459 --> 00:00:36,720
Van Orden

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,240
and De La Rey, Myers,

15
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:45,270
Van Orden. Do you know anything about their names or why they were named their names?

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,080
Uh

17
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,319
No.

18
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,240
OK. Good question.

19
00:00:51,849 --> 00:00:53,099
Well, I mean, I don't know,

20
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,610
I wish we would have asked a lot of these

21
00:00:56,619 --> 00:01:00,319
questions years and years ago when we had them around.

22
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,029
I know,

23
00:01:01,139 --> 00:01:03,500
I mean, I still have that video I did of them.

24
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,889
Yeah. So that's a little helpful but

25
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,989
uh I haven't even looked at all these questions. I don't even know what they all are.

26
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,129
OK. So where were they each born?

27
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,959
Uh Grandpa was born in Smithfield, Utah.

28
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,589
Was he born?

29
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:24,889
Do you know if he was born at home or anything like that?

30
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:25,610
Uh

31
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,800
I don't know that.

32
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,940
I know grandma Della

33
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,519
was born in Beaver,

34
00:01:32,529 --> 00:01:38,010
Utah and I know Aunt Carol and Uncle Carl were born on the kitchen table.

35
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,319
So I assume maybe

36
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,910
grandma was. Wow,

37
00:01:43,139 --> 00:01:45,330
kitchen table. That sounds comfortable.

38
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,489
Um And then do you know anything about like

39
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,080
what their town was like that they grew up in

40
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,849
like Smithfield,

41
00:01:57,099 --> 00:01:58,050
Beaver?

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,099
Uh They were small towns.

43
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,050
You

44
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:02,230
a

45
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:05,500
small town, Beaver was a small town.

46
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:06,419
Uh

47
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:12,460
grandpa moved there when he was kind of, I think a teenager. I think he

48
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,619
was in high school because his dad went there to run the pharmacy.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,820
And so his,

50
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:22,210
his dad had always been a pharmacist. Right.

51
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:24,979
Yes. Harris. Oh,

52
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,619
I think his name was Harris

53
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,869
and Van

54
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:28,380
Orden.

55
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:29,339
Ok.

56
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,029
And then what did grandma, what did Grandpa Myers do?

57
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:39,770
Grandpa Myers worked on the train. So he worked for Union Pacific

58
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:45,839
and he did that his whole life until he died. He died really young.

59
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:50,000
I think he was 56 when he died. And how did, do you know how he died?

60
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:52,669
He had a heart attack?

61
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:53,990
Oh, wow. Ok.

62
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:54,779
Yeah.

63
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:56,839
So, um,

64
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,059
that was, that was sad.

65
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,149
And you were,

66
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,369
how

67
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:03,979
old were you?

68
00:03:04,509 --> 00:03:11,619
I was about, I was 14 or 16. I can't remember. I know dad had gone to a Utah game

69
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:13,410
and taken

70
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,330
a couple of the kids with them. Maybe, maybe Gene.

71
00:03:17,339 --> 00:03:21,289
I, I don't know for, well, they, they would have been young boys then.

72
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,619
But, um,

73
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:28,889
grandpa died and they had to go find Grandpa Ross at the

74
00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:32,600
Utah game to tell him so he could come home and tell grandma

75
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,949
and she was really upset.

76
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,460
I bet.

77
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:40,929
Wow. Ok. I didn't know that

78
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,289
did. Um And so grandma was the oldest. Grandpa was the youngest. Right.

79
00:03:47,369 --> 00:03:48,729
Grandpa was the baby.

80
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:52,779
Grandma was the oldest. And she had,

81
00:03:53,339 --> 00:03:54,809
let's see, there was

82
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:01,119
Della Carol, Carol Bert and Kay.

83
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,130
Ok.

84
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,389
And her and Kay,

85
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,440
how far apart are her? And Aunt Kay?

86
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:08,229
Well

87
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:10,479
Kay was,

88
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,399
let's see,

89
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,500
cause isn't she just like five years older than you? She's,

90
00:04:16,619 --> 00:04:18,950
yeah, she's five years older than me.

91
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,809
And so how do you figure that?

92
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,920
So if grandma wasn't grandma, 20 years older than you,

93
00:04:25,929 --> 00:04:28,019
so they would have been 15 years apart.

94
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,869
Yeah, they would have been, they would have been

95
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,350
so 15 years apart from the oldest to the youngest.

96
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:36,290
And then in grandpa's family, was it,

97
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:40,420
was he a lot younger than all of his siblings or did he have siblings closer to his age?

98
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:45,230
Uh I don't know how old they were. I know that he had,

99
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,450
there were

100
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:50,910
um his oldest brother was Harris. Uncle Harris. Do you know him?

101
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,209
He was a professor at Utah State quite,

102
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:58,049
you know, quite renowned, pretty famous.

103
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,739
Um His brother Dale was in the military

104
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,730
and he lived all over the world,

105
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:08,149
I think it was in the Navy.

106
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:10,589
And then um

107
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,630
Aunt Brenda

108
00:05:14,369 --> 00:05:19,920
and she was at Pearl Harbor with Uncle Randall when they bombed Pearl Harbor.

109
00:05:19,929 --> 00:05:20,839
Oh, really?

110
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:22,959
Wow.

111
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:23,910
And then,

112
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,179
um,

113
00:05:28,049 --> 00:05:28,790
and then Aunt

114
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:29,670
Eileen.

115
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:30,700
Ok. Well,

116
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:33,450
and then dad, and then Ross,

117
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:36,950
so they five kids. So three boys and two girls.

118
00:05:37,609 --> 00:05:38,130
Yeah.

119
00:05:38,429 --> 00:05:38,989
Ok.

120
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,750
So they got married

121
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,820
in the Saint George Temple.

122
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:47,420
June.

123
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:49,100
June 29th.

124
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:53,369
June 29th. Was that 1931?

125
00:05:53,809 --> 00:05:55,779
No, grandma was born in 31.

126
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,380
Ok. So, I don't know what year they got married but they were, they were pretty young.

127
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:01,529
Um,

128
00:06:01,739 --> 00:06:05,119
grandpa had gone to a year of college at the U

129
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,989
and grandma had finished her last high school year.

130
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,529
Remember she went to the prom with some?

131
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:14,369
That's right. She did do that.

132
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,850
And I think it might have been 49.

133
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:23,730
They got married. I'm trying to remember when we had their 50th wedding anniversary

134
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:25,549
at

135
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,059
the Lion House

136
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,980
and it was after my mission.

137
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,559
It might have been

138
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,920
99.

139
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:38,579
Yeah, it could have been 98 or 99.

140
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:43,760
I would think. I don't, I, I wish I had all these dates.

141
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:46,700
Well, I'm sure I can figure that out. Like I can look at their thing.

142
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,809
What do you, what family traditions did grandma

143
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,220
have that came from her family that you can think of?

144
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,059
Well, they were

145
00:06:58,609 --> 00:07:01,679
grandma was a big fan of Christmas.

146
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:08,459
So I don't know if she was in her family. I don't know if grandma Zelma was like that,

147
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:10,859
but it seems like

148
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:17,190
I think Christmas just started getting more and more and more

149
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,750
expensive as people

150
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,290
because when grandma Myers,

151
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,700
like, she lived during the depression,

152
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,230
so it was not, they were always,

153
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:34,230
they were really careful with all of their resources and

154
00:07:34,429 --> 00:07:37,220
she always canned and bottle things.

155
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,549
She always, I mean, they weren't wasteful with anything.

156
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,880
Ok. Well, as each generation got a little more affluent, a little more affluent.

157
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:47,790
I think

158
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,279
it was more,

159
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,299
you know, you had more things. I mean, we always had

160
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,399
tons of stuff at Christmas.

161
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:00,739
Like grandma was a splurge. So, where did the candy? Um,

162
00:08:01,989 --> 00:08:02,350
the,

163
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,489
the candy

164
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:03,790
can

165
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:04,660
come

166
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:04,899
from?

167
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:08,290
And when we lived in the Granger,

168
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:14,339
I don't know what Granger Ward we lived in. I, I was thinking it was the 19th but I, I

169
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:16,260
don't know if that was right.

170
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:20,559
They had friends named Lloyd and Ardine Foot

171
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,019
and apparently Lloyd and Ardine started making chocolates.

172
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:28,750
I don't know if they already knew how to make them and

173
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,030
he just invited mom and dad or they all just decided,

174
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,270
hey, this would be so fun. Let's do this.

175
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:39,150
They started making pecan rolls and

176
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:43,630
all kinds of chocolates like cherry orange cream,

177
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,390
you know. So that was a tradition.

178
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,400
They started because of with their friends and then they just always

179
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:50,700
done

180
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,200
and they would, um,

181
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,640
they would make chocolates every year and they would go

182
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,880
and they'd be there till one in the morning.

183
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:00,400
You know, they, that was

184
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,679
they love to do that at Christmas time.

185
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,719
And then it kind of became a tradition that grandpa, when he was the bishop,

186
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,599
they would make enough pecan rolls so they could

187
00:09:09,609 --> 00:09:13,000
give one to every little widow in the ward.

188
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,919
Oh, ok.

189
00:09:15,549 --> 00:09:20,690
And that became a big tradition. They would have a Christmas party for all the widows

190
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:22,650
and the widows loved it.

191
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:24,690
They would come and Dean and Emma Lou would

192
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,010
play the piano and they would sing Christmas songs

193
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:29,059
and grandma

194
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,530
would make a huge meal

195
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:32,210
and

196
00:09:32,929 --> 00:09:37,070
feed them. And then their little gift was a pecan.

197
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,539
Oh, that's so cute. I didn't know they did that.

198
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:42,869
They

199
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,429
did that.

200
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:44,580
I

201
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:50,099
think that's why they were so loved by everybody because they always were

202
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,559
really unselfish with their

203
00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:00,539
successes. I mean, it would probably cost a lot of money to make pecan rolls for

204
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,340
20 ladies or, you know.

205
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:04,809
So, I don't know.

206
00:10:06,609 --> 00:10:10,349
I didn't know that's what I didn't know they did. That. That's really cool. Did they?

207
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:10,739
Um,

208
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,669
that is really cool.

209
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,739
So,

210
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:16,969
they were always active in the church.

211
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,880
They never were not active.

212
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,789
And when the families they came from were both of the families they came from.

213
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:31,369
So my grandma and grandpa Myers didn't get married in the temple,

214
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,299
I think till a few years later,

215
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:36,369
I don't think they were married in the temple originally.

216
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,619
But I believe grandpa and grandma Van Orden were

217
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:42,289
in

218
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:42,479
temple.

219
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:47,080
But I, I would imagine they were married in the Logan Temple. But I don't,

220
00:10:47,219 --> 00:10:49,799
I guess I could look that up. It probably says that

221
00:10:49,969 --> 00:10:51,340
on family search somewhere,

222
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:52,929
I

223
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:53,489
think.

224
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,940
Did they have,

225
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:57,890
did either of them have siblings that went on missions?

226
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,690
Oh, that's a good question. I know. Dad did not go on a mission because of the army.

227
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,320
And back then. You,

228
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,299
you kind of, I

229
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,869
don't know if it was a calling to go on a mission

230
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,520
but people didn't just go on missions like they do now.

231
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,460
Well, I, one,

232
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:20,219
I know because of the army at one point it was like you were only allowed to let

233
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:25,080
so many people serve and go on mission. So you had to be called to do that.

234
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:28,940
So that's probably a big part of that generation that didn't.

235
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:29,739
And

236
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:30,309
so

237
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,750
I think

238
00:11:32,369 --> 00:11:32,950
Uncle Bet

239
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,429
went on a mission.

240
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:35,890
Oh, he did?

241
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:41,229
I think Uncle Burt did. But I, I couldn't swear by that. But

242
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,150
it seems like

243
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,390
Uncle Burt was a lot younger than mom.

244
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:51,789
So did grandpa's brothers serve in World War Two because they were older than him.

245
00:11:52,489 --> 00:11:54,049
Yeah, they had

246
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:57,750
Grandpa Myers. They, they had people in the army

247
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:00,909
but I don't know if he did,

248
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,669
but they were all at that age where they probably

249
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:11,330
did have to go and I would imagine that they probably lost brothers.

250
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:14,289
Grandpa Myers had 12 brothers and sisters.

251
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,909
Oh, I didn't know that. Wow. Yeah, he was from a really big family. And

252
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:23,549
he was, he was close. He would always go and

253
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:28,080
he had, uh, his youngest sister was, um,

254
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,119
she had, she was, what do you call?

255
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,090
I can't even think of it,

256
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,849
like special names or something.

257
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:41,299
Yeah. It's, it's a common thing.

258
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:41,780
What's

259
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,099
it

260
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,650
called? Oh, like

261
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,130
Down Syndrome?

262
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:47,789
Ok.

263
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:48,729
Syndrome.

264
00:12:48,989 --> 00:12:51,669
And so he would always go,

265
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:55,679
I don't know if his dad died kind of young also,

266
00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:00,750
but he would always go and take care of his mother and made sure she had

267
00:13:01,099 --> 00:13:04,909
everything she needed. And I remember going to their house

268
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,609
and I thought it was kind of scary because the youngest daughter was named Vertamae.

269
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,729
And you know, those people, they always like to kind of touch

270
00:13:12,849 --> 00:13:12,929
your

271
00:13:14,609 --> 00:13:14,659
hands

272
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,859
and it would kind of scare me. I probably was only four or five.

273
00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:21,840
Oh, yeah. I remember going there.

274
00:13:21,849 --> 00:13:26,330
They always had a black frying pan on the stove with an egg in it.

275
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,390
Ok.

276
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:29,549
I

277
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,530
remember

278
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,659
that's interesting.

279
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:37,270
But he would always make sure, you know that he, his mom

280
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:38,710
was taken care of.

281
00:13:40,229 --> 00:13:43,549
So did Grandpa Ross's brother serve in World War Two.

282
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:46,039
Then the one that was in the army, Dale

283
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,669
and Harris,

284
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:48,940
I think

285
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:50,780
they,

286
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,710
they were at that age where they could have.

287
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:55,039
But I don't know.

288
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:01,729
Ok. I was just curious. Well, I know Uncle Randy was about their age and he served in,

289
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,289
he was at Pearl Harbor. So

290
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:07,619
I would think those two older brothers because

291
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,650
he was married to Brenda who was younger.

292
00:14:10,109 --> 00:14:10,340
So,

293
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:16,090
I would think those two older brothers could have very well been in the service.

294
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:18,780
That's a good question.

295
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,989
Well, you know, I don't know. Um, what, so grandma

296
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:26,309
didn't never work. Grandpa was a pharmacist.

297
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:27,669
Did grandma ever?

298
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:34,229
Grandma worked a little bit at a department store called the Merck? That was right.

299
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:38,700
Just a few doors down from Grandpa's drug store. She did,

300
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,799
she worked there on and off. But not,

301
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:44,460
it might have been when

302
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,219
I'm trying to think if it was, when Scott was on a mission.

303
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:50,690
I can't remember.

304
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:51,770
I don't know

305
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:53,059
her a little bit.

306
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,239
Ok.

307
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:01,109
And then what was like the daily growing up?

308
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:04,770
Did you guys read scriptures or do anything like that?

309
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,520
Because I felt like that wasn't something you did a lot

310
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,950
in that generation. Like they encourage, like home church now.

311
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,169
Yeah. No, it wasn't like that at all.

312
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:20,590
In fact, grandpa and grandma would try and have family home evening and we were

313
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:21,859
not

314
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,349
good kids. So, pretty much like every other family.

315
00:15:26,099 --> 00:15:26,630
Yeah.

316
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:27,520
Ok.

317
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,340
So we didn't, and I think,

318
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:35,619
you know, cuz when I got married I didn't go to church for

319
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:41,729
several years. Probably tell you were probably about three or four or five.

320
00:15:41,739 --> 00:15:45,650
So, did you not believe it or were you lazy or why didn't you go? I was,

321
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,859
I, well, we moved around a lot so we were in different wards. And I never felt,

322
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,820
I know when I lived in Wyoming and I had Vicky

323
00:15:54,349 --> 00:15:56,890
Troy's wife. I would go with her

324
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,479
and we, I remember

325
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:07,979
we went to some steak leadership thing one night and I went with her and

326
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,960
it could have been a women's conference or something. But we had to drive to Randolph

327
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:15,309
to go to it. Oh, you did?

328
00:16:15,789 --> 00:16:16,280
Yeah.

329
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:19,640
So that was part of their steak. And,

330
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:24,719
yeah, I remember going with her and I went with her a few times when I lived in,

331
00:16:25,469 --> 00:16:29,419
I think I only would go to Sacrament meeting with her when we lived in.

332
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:31,809
Yo, not Yost when we lived in,

333
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,080
in that big court

334
00:16:35,219 --> 00:16:35,969
house.

335
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:36,809
So,

336
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,859
so growing up at your house, how much was the church? Like, what was the life?

337
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,460
What was church like for you

338
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,869
church? We would go, would get up and go to Sunday school.

339
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,080
Then you'd go home and you'd go back

340
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:53,719
and then you'd have,

341
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:56,880
we had to go to church three times every Sunday

342
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,159
and Sacrament meeting was later in the day.

343
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:02,750
And so we'd go to Sunday.

344
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:06,848
Maybe it was Sunday school and primary. We're together.

345
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:09,130
No, primary was during the week.

346
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:10,680
I, I remember

347
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:14,189
like on Wednesday I did go to primary during

348
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,920
the week when we first lived in Taylorsville.

349
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,209
I remember going,

350
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,417
yeah,

351
00:17:19,568 --> 00:17:20,898
but it's when I was like,

352
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,920
kindergarten or first grade, I was really little.

353
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,900
You were about that old when we moved there because

354
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:34,939
Reggie was born in 78 and that's when we moved to Taylorsville. And

355
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,719
so you were born in 72? So you were only about six?

356
00:17:40,829 --> 00:17:41,290
Yeah,

357
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:42,939
that's right.

358
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:49,770
And we lived in another house. We bought another house that was over off of 3200 West.

359
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,689
And we lived there only about a year because we ended

360
00:17:52,699 --> 00:17:55,969
up moving to Wyoming for your dad to work at the,

361
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,810
oh, I remember that house phone company. And then we had, do you remember that house?

362
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:02,959
And

363
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,569
I remember we painted the bedroom yellow

364
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,969
before Zack was born because we,

365
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:15,640
we didn't know what the sex of a baby was then. Oh, right. No, I remember that house.

366
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,270
I have a few memories.

367
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,599
I remember climbing on the counter and falling and breaking my arm,

368
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:21,650
taking your arm.

369
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:24,270
Um, I remember

370
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:26,829
just a couple of vague

371
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,359
memories from that house, but I remember it.

372
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,520
I mean, we even had a garden in the back which was, don't

373
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:34,839
ask,

374
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:37,140
I don't remember planting it,

375
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,459
but I know we had a garden

376
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,819
which is weird because maybe your dad was like a real farmer.

377
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:46,660
Then I don't, I can't remember.

378
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:49,089
Well, good to know.

379
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:50,380
What about

380
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,150
what he was

381
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:52,579
hanging.

382
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,989
Well, your dad was hanging sheetrock at that time and he was working in Park City?

383
00:18:57,829 --> 00:19:00,650
Oh, so he drive all the way up to Park City every day.

384
00:19:02,329 --> 00:19:06,270
So, what memories do you have of going to your

385
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,089
to grandma Meyer's house.

386
00:19:09,939 --> 00:19:14,260
I just remember when I was a little girl, we would, we didn't have suitcases.

387
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:19,239
We would put all of our clothes in liquor boxes because there was a liquor store

388
00:19:19,369 --> 00:19:20,949
in Grandpa's drug store.

389
00:19:21,739 --> 00:19:26,410
And so we would get liquor boxes and be able to put our clothes in there.

390
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,010
And that's what we would use

391
00:19:28,219 --> 00:19:29,729
as a suitcase.

392
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,400
And we would go to grandma's for,

393
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:37,589
I don't know, at least a week or so. And we would,

394
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:42,550
we always remembered everyone would meet out on that back porch

395
00:19:43,969 --> 00:19:46,770
and we would just hang out there. We would,

396
00:19:46,989 --> 00:19:50,150
I mean, it was like a farm, like the whole,

397
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:50,989
the whole,

398
00:19:51,989 --> 00:19:56,369
I don't know what the directions are, but south of grandma's house was a huge garden,

399
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,130
like corn and tomatoes and beans,

400
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:01,130
everything you can imagine.

401
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,010
And farther down than that was like a giant chicken coop.

402
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:05,709
And,

403
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:07,479
and they had pigs

404
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,250
and all the leftovers from dinner and that they

405
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,449
would haul down and throw into the pigs.

406
00:20:12,459 --> 00:20:12,969
And

407
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,800
then they had a really big pasture.

408
00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:20,930
When you walk out that back door, there was a huge pasture and grandma had, uh,

409
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,160
clothes lines out there that she would hang the clothes on.

410
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,270
I didn't even think about that.

411
00:20:27,949 --> 00:20:31,250
Yeah. And they had a ditch, that little ditch that ran down. I

412
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,489
remember the ditch.

413
00:20:33,469 --> 00:20:35,170
We played in the ditch

414
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:39,810
all the time. And I remember when, um, I was probably about

415
00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:41,699
nine or 10.

416
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,260
Steven would,

417
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:46,109
Stephen had a horse and they would come over and

418
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,459
we would get on the horse like four of us

419
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,810
and we'd go from grandma's house to Steven's house and

420
00:20:53,689 --> 00:20:56,760
Aunt Fanny made the best chocolate cake in the world.

421
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:57,449
That

422
00:20:57,739 --> 00:20:57,959
sounds good.

423
00:20:58,739 --> 00:21:00,910
She made it with potatoes

424
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,920
with potatoes.

425
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,140
Well, you put potatoes in it and it makes it really moist.

426
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,760
Like mashed potatoes or raw potatoes.

427
00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:11,150
No, mashed potatoes.

428
00:21:11,329 --> 00:21:12,369
That's so weird.

429
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,839
Leftover mashed potatoes to make cakes. So,

430
00:21:15,969 --> 00:21:17,959
why didn't you ever make that for us?

431
00:21:19,229 --> 00:21:23,770
Well, I hadn't thought about it but I did try and make a chocolate cake.

432
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,219
I looked on the internet to find an A

433
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,630
recipe

434
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,130
and I did try it.

435
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:31,140
Was it good?

436
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,359
Probably? Probably not the way I made it.

437
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,390
Um,

438
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,280
ok, let me see. What other,

439
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,959
so grandpa went to the U,

440
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,829
was that his, his plan always to go be a pharmacist? Or do you even know?

441
00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:54,869
I think it was his plan. And we lived up on the Avenues when uh,

442
00:21:56,459 --> 00:21:59,359
we had grandpa had a really good friend

443
00:22:01,109 --> 00:22:04,209
and they had little kids the same age as Julie and I,

444
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:10,209
and we lived in a little tiny house and I think there was only like a hot plate

445
00:22:10,709 --> 00:22:13,199
and I don't know if they even had an oven.

446
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:19,390
And I remember when I was little, I fell and cut my wrist right here.

447
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,250
A great big giant cut and I've got stitches

448
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,890
to this day

449
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,050
I

450
00:22:26,489 --> 00:22:27,729
did. Yeah, I have a scar.

451
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,089
So,

452
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,829
anyway, and I think we lived,

453
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm,

454
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:34,819
I don't know,

455
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:39,069
you know how the houses have stairs that would go up the side of the house.

456
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:39,349
Yeah.

457
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:44,900
It seems like maybe we had to do that or maybe we were just on a one level.

458
00:22:45,969 --> 00:22:48,349
I don't know, just little tiny though.

459
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:52,239
So, you lived up there when he was going to school or you lived up there at,

460
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,750
when he first started working?

461
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:58,839
No, we lived up there when he was going to school and then

462
00:22:58,949 --> 00:23:01,959
he got hired by a na A man named Mr Crier

463
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:05,660
up in Wyoming. And we moved to Evanston for like

464
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,319
two or three years. Oh,

465
00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:07,469
I

466
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:08,400
forgot that.

467
00:23:08,949 --> 00:23:08,969
Yeah.

468
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:09,479
And

469
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:12,839
when I went to kindergarten in Evanston

470
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:17,390
and then we moved and I, we moved to Kerns

471
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,099
and I don't know if we were buying this house or renting it.

472
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:27,229
But once he got established in the drugstore, he wanted to be closer

473
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:29,930
to where he worked. So that's why we moved.

474
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:33,739
We moved over to that other neighborhood.

475
00:23:34,089 --> 00:23:36,530
So did he open that drug store?

476
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,579
Like that was his, that he owned the one that was in Granger.

477
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,339
He owned it with Mr Crider.

478
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,510
Oh, he owned it with Mr Crier?

479
00:23:43,829 --> 00:23:44,280
Ok.

480
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:47,030
So he had a partner and, and there,

481
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,900
I don't know if he had another partner besides that,

482
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:54,670
but I think he was really successful for,

483
00:23:55,609 --> 00:23:59,380
I think he must have owned that for about 20 years, 25 years.

484
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,270
The pharmacy

485
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,780
or the drug store,

486
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,339
the drugstore.

487
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:07,430
You,

488
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,709
you don't remember that drug store, do you?

489
00:24:09,939 --> 00:24:11,030
No, I remember it.

490
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,550
I remember going,

491
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,430
I remember going there and,

492
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,390
yeah, I remember being like,

493
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,699
probably kindergarten

494
00:24:22,969 --> 00:24:25,839
and I remember they had like a freezer that had sn

495
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,790
sn grow popsicles.

496
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:28,290
Oh,

497
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:28,859
yeah.

498
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:34,180
And I remember that they were just really good popsicles. And then I remember going

499
00:24:35,069 --> 00:24:39,010
one time it was closed and we got, we went in and grandpa said,

500
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,130
if you don't set off the alarm, then you can choose a treat

501
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,530
because we had to be like really quiet or something.

502
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,780
And so I remember choosing a candy bar,

503
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:53,510
but I remember going there and Laurie being there working or something.

504
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,630
I remember going there a few times

505
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,069
but I was little,

506
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,780
we all worked there. I worked there. Julie worked there.

507
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,510
But I don't think by the time I remember going,

508
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,239
I don't think it still had like the soda fountain part.

509
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:11,150
Did they always have that or did they stop that? At some point?

510
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,510
I thought they always had it

511
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,949
up until when they closed, which they could have.

512
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:19,390
I just don't remember, I don't remember ever like eating there.

513
00:25:21,349 --> 00:25:24,939
Well, in high school we still had it because I would work there at night and

514
00:25:25,369 --> 00:25:30,030
your dad would come in and visit me and other boys would come in and visit me So,

515
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:32,430
yeah, we had it in high school.

516
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,160
So I don't remember

517
00:25:35,329 --> 00:25:37,849
the soda fountains part, but I remember

518
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:40,199
Snelgrove's Popsicles

519
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,329
because I thought they were super amazing

520
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:49,770
and they probably were. So, what about other holiday traditions?

521
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,050
Was there any other holiday traditions?

522
00:25:54,739 --> 00:25:58,229
Were holidays always just a big deal because grandma made him a big deal.

523
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:01,520
Holidays were a big deal because I think grandma made him

524
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,239
a big deal and she liked to decorate for the holidays,

525
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,439
different holidays.

526
00:26:05,449 --> 00:26:06,229
You know, like

527
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:10,479
for Easter we always got Easter baskets and it

528
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,699
probably,

529
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,420
I don't know what we used to get. I remember birthdays were big.

530
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:21,469
She was really good about birthdays. Um,

531
00:26:22,939 --> 00:26:26,439
and then Julie and Laurie and I, we left, you know,

532
00:26:26,449 --> 00:26:31,520
we were so much older than the three boys and their life was way different than ours.

533
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,489
So, what's the gap between Laurie and Jean?

534
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,209
Well, they're only a year between Laurie and t,

535
00:26:38,219 --> 00:26:41,040
but Laurie got married when she was 17.

536
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,660
Oh, I forgot. That's true.

537
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:48,000
And so she was out of the house a year later.

538
00:26:49,209 --> 00:26:49,589
I,

539
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,130
no, I think Julie got married first

540
00:26:54,689 --> 00:26:55,359
then.

541
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,900
Would you just text? Well, I guess I

542
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,430
will text it. So she needs right home.

543
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:02,140
Never mind. Go ahead.

544
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,869
So, wait, Julie got married before you did.

545
00:27:06,109 --> 00:27:07,420
Yeah, she did.

546
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,660
And I think Laurie got married.

547
00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:13,180
I can't remember if Laura got married before me,

548
00:27:13,189 --> 00:27:16,020
but I think she did because she used to tend you

549
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,060
I remember her tending me.

550
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,329
I have a couple of memories of her

551
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,150
watching me.

552
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:26,119
I can't remember if she got married before me or I got married before her.

553
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:28,660
But she used to babysit you when I worked.

554
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:30,349
Ok.

555
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,420
And then

556
00:27:31,829 --> 00:27:31,949
are

557
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,599
Gene and

558
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:39,390
Gene. And, um, Chad, is there a bigger gap between them then Jane and Chad?

559
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,800
Yeah, there's maybe two or three years,

560
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:51,069
but there's a bigger gap between Chad and Scott, like, four or five years or more.

561
00:27:51,699 --> 00:27:53,180
I think so. Ok.

562
00:27:55,219 --> 00:27:57,750
So what are some of grandpa's?

563
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,390
What were some of his favorite things that you, when you think about grandpa?

564
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,949
Like, what were some of his favorite things where he did growing up? His

565
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:09,780
favorite thing was Aunt Pearl's chocolate cake.

566
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,290
I

567
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:11,550
remember that

568
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:18,160
the way his mom would make pot roast on top of the stove with carrots and potatoes.

569
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,160
It was like the best.

570
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,420
And we used to go up there every now and then and she would always make that dinner

571
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,770
because she knew dad liked it so much.

572
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,959
And, um,

573
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,319
I don't know,

574
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,790
I think

575
00:28:35,829 --> 00:28:39,060
dad didn't like Adeline's husband but

576
00:28:39,189 --> 00:28:40,130
at all,

577
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:46,270
but I think he was unfaithful to Anneline and grandpa was

578
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,969
straight up.

579
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:49,839
Right.

580
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:50,750
Yeah,

581
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,410
I'm not gonna

582
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:54,209
give you the time of day

583
00:28:54,949 --> 00:28:56,140
and I think that

584
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:00,209
I never actually heard them say that,

585
00:29:00,469 --> 00:29:03,829
but I, I think something like that happened.

586
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:09,619
So, when, how old was his dad when his dad passed away? Because wasn't he younger?

587
00:29:10,459 --> 00:29:12,150
He was like 51.

588
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,369
He was young.

589
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:14,670
And what happened?

590
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:18,689
He might have been even 60. But

591
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:22,500
he was working at the drugstore in Park City

592
00:29:23,109 --> 00:29:24,130
and they lived,

593
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,219
they lived above the drugstore and you'd have to walk up these little creaky

594
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:31,000
stairs to get to the apartment. And I remember staying there

595
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,500
and we had left and had just been to see them

596
00:29:36,189 --> 00:29:36,969
and,

597
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:43,329
you know, we didn't have cell phones. So I can't remember if we drove home

598
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:45,890
and then they called dad and said,

599
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,339
you know, your dad has passed away

600
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:53,699
and it was really, it was in the winter, really bad roads. Really? Lots of snow.

601
00:29:54,189 --> 00:29:56,630
But what happened? Did he have a heart attack or something?

602
00:29:57,699 --> 00:29:59,630
Yeah, he had a heart attack. Wow.

603
00:30:00,569 --> 00:30:04,510
So then is that when Grandma Van Orden moved back to Smithfield,

604
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,959
grandma Van

605
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:08,260
Orden lived with an

606
00:30:08,449 --> 00:30:13,150
E on the avenues. They had a house on the avenues in Salt Lake City and

607
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:17,119
the basement had a little apartment with a bedroom

608
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,579
and a bathroom and a little living room area.

609
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:20,650
And that's where Grandma

610
00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:21,790
Ben Orden lived.

611
00:30:22,089 --> 00:30:24,589
And then when Aunt Pearl,

612
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,250
I think that was Aunt Pearl's house and she was a school teacher.

613
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:31,969
So I think when she quit teaching school,

614
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:36,630
grandma moved up and they lived together for a lot of years. Ok.

615
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,959
Because I remember going, I remember going to that

616
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,359
house, that

617
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,130
house up there. Yes.

618
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,020
Ok.

619
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:48,469
Cause I didn't realize they had lived. Ok. That makes sense now.

620
00:30:48,949 --> 00:30:49,469
Yeah.

621
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:50,189
And that's,

622
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:55,390
and that's when she moved up with Aunt Pearl and then Aunt Pearl got cancer

623
00:30:56,569 --> 00:30:59,140
and passed away. And then

624
00:30:59,939 --> 00:31:01,579
I don't know

625
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,339
if grandma just kept living in that house alone or what?

626
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:08,500
I can't remember.

627
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,550
You know what?

628
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:16,060
I, I do know what happened because grandma, she started kind of

629
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,510
losing her mind and her memory.

630
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:26,530
And so they put her in a home, a nursing home right there on Redwood Road.

631
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:32,270
And Grandpa Ross went in there one day and he was not happy

632
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,989
with what he saw and he brought her home and took care of her

633
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,229
the rest of her life. I remember her living there,

634
00:31:42,849 --> 00:31:45,790
but I don't remember it being super long. Was it?

635
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:50,250
Well, I don't, I don't think she survived very long. I don't,

636
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,699
it seems like a grandma said it was almost two years before she passed away. But

637
00:31:56,729 --> 00:31:59,390
because I remember going over there and Grandma

638
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,390
Van Orden being when she lived there, they,

639
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:08,160
I remember she moved there and lived there and I was just, I was a kid still,

640
00:32:09,619 --> 00:32:11,589
but I don't remember how long it was.

641
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:13,849
She was there. She had to

642
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,579
like they had to change her diapers, they had to feed her.

643
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:20,750
I mean, grandma was a saint grandma Dela

644
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,329
for two years.

645
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:28,380
I think it was two years. But I'm not positive, but

646
00:32:29,459 --> 00:32:31,560
it makes me cry because

647
00:32:32,109 --> 00:32:33,439
I could never do that.

648
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:38,800
And I remember her asking me to come over and even babysit, you know,

649
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:42,300
and take care of her just while she get to leave for an hour.

650
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:45,199
And I, I hated it. I hated it.

651
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:47,229
So that makes me feel bad

652
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,380
that I wasn't.

653
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:50,609
It's ok.

654
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,670
We, we grandma can receive the blessings for that. She,

655
00:32:55,579 --> 00:32:59,550
I'll, we'll give her credit for that because I didn't know she did that.

656
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,150
Yeah, she did that. And I, I

657
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:07,099
can't remember if they had a lady that came in and helped them. Sometimes

658
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:08,790
I can't remember.

659
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:12,109
Well, and grandma Myers came and lived with them for a little while too.

660
00:33:12,979 --> 00:33:13,040
Grandma

661
00:33:13,939 --> 00:33:16,510
Myers never, she didn't lose her mind.

662
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,869
And I don't think grandma Myers ever had to wear diapers or anything like that.

663
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,270
No, I remember,

664
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:25,329
I remember going and being with her because

665
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:27,699
grandma and grandpa were going somewhere one night

666
00:33:27,819 --> 00:33:29,939
and she was completely still.

667
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:31,280
Her mind was good.

668
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:32,459
Yes.

669
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:33,189
Yeah.

670
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:34,489
And she was good.

671
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,589
And then she ended up at Aunt Kay's and I remember going

672
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:41,469
there and being with her once or twice for Aunt Kay,

673
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,900
but she always was fine.

674
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:44,650
Yeah.

675
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,390
No, I remember going

676
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,469
and being there one time

677
00:33:48,939 --> 00:33:49,390
at Grandma

678
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:49,849
Della's

679
00:33:50,689 --> 00:33:55,420
and she ended up, let's see. I know she ended up back in Beaver

680
00:33:56,329 --> 00:34:01,660
and I don't know if she was with somebody or she got to go back to her house,

681
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,729
but she died in the Beaver Hospital. I'm pretty Sure.

682
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:06,969
Oh, grandma Meyer

683
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:07,430
said.

684
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,280
Yeah,

685
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:12,649
because I remember going there one time and we all got to go in and see her

686
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:17,570
and she didn't pass away. They thought she would and she didn't, and then a

687
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:21,310
few months later she did. So,

688
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:25,790
and I don't know if she maybe was living in the nursing home down there.

689
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,850
She could have been,

690
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:29,438
I don't remember.

691
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,350
Aunt Kay probably does.

692
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:35,340
Yeah. Aunt Kay would remember. She would remember for sure.

693
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:41,760
So what were some of the favorite foods you had in your house growing up?

694
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:42,780
That your family

695
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,649
like a

696
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:47,600
cream tuna on toast?

697
00:34:51,099 --> 00:34:54,138
And we had a ton of mac and cheese.

698
00:34:54,549 --> 00:34:58,769
Ok. That's funny because when I asked grandma and grandpa their favorite food,

699
00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:02,198
both of them said homemade mac and cheese,

700
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:04,118
but they weren't together when they said it.

701
00:35:04,128 --> 00:35:06,878
I was talking to grandpa or grandma first

702
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:08,418
and asked

703
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:11,350
and one of them said homemade mac and cheese and then

704
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,070
the other one later came in the room and I said,

705
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,899
what's been like your favorite food that you would want growing up?

706
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:17,629
And they said homemade mac and cheese?

707
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,310
Yeah, that was her favorite. And it was our favorite. And

708
00:35:21,669 --> 00:35:25,989
I think it's funny that Grandma Della never made homemade chicken noodle soup.

709
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,050
I never remember her doing that.

710
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,649
That's weird.

711
00:35:29,949 --> 00:35:35,969
And that was always my favorite thing when I'd go to grandma. It was, it's delicious.

712
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:41,520
She always made it. Well, I even remember her coming to our house.

713
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,949
I swear she came to our house in Taylorsville one time and it was,

714
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:48,379
when I was younger it was like a long, long time ago.

715
00:35:48,389 --> 00:35:48,659
But

716
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:51,179
I swear she made noodles one time

717
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,030
and you guys made it

718
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:53,939
and she could,

719
00:35:54,149 --> 00:35:54,459
she

720
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,969
could, she could have

721
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,870
because she came to our house is

722
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,020
our favorite. And I don't know when we started

723
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:05,479
using mashed potatoes in our chicken noodle soup.

724
00:36:05,939 --> 00:36:08,419
I just thought that's how you always made it for us.

725
00:36:08,429 --> 00:36:10,560
So I assume that's how grandma always did it.

726
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:11,189
Grandma

727
00:36:11,449 --> 00:36:13,439
Meyers. She, she didn't make it that way.

728
00:36:13,449 --> 00:36:16,989
We just had, in fact, she would, they would cook the chicken

729
00:36:17,429 --> 00:36:22,399
for a long time and she would make noodles and they would just put

730
00:36:22,409 --> 00:36:26,830
maybe one carrot or one celery in there to give it some flavor.

731
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,090
Oh,

732
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:32,969
and she would cook old roosters and that's what they'd use for the meat.

733
00:36:32,979 --> 00:36:35,419
And so she'd pick all the meat off the bones

734
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,169
and then she would cook her noodles.

735
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:39,320
And that, like,

736
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:44,770
my soup is pretty different from hers because I put a lot of carrots and celery.

737
00:36:45,389 --> 00:36:46,360
But, uh,

738
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,280
yeah, that was just always our favorite. So, grandma

739
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,510
never made that. Huh?

740
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:54,919
No. And they used to have for breakfast. They were the best at Grandma Meyer.

741
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,479
She would have, she would fry eggs

742
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:02,469
and then you could have sliced tomatoes. She had homemade bread for toast.

743
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:08,250
I mean, it was just the best because it was all like, homemade on the farm food.

744
00:37:08,909 --> 00:37:09,370
Yeah,

745
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:10,810
it was.

746
00:37:11,419 --> 00:37:16,770
And I don't ever remember eating tomatoes with our fried eggs at our house.

747
00:37:17,989 --> 00:37:18,870
And

748
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:19,959
that's funny. I

749
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:23,780
think it's funny how different things I pressure

750
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:24,179
and

751
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:27,629
also I remember when we would go down in the spring

752
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:32,040
they would get a whole box load, like 50 baby chicks.

753
00:37:33,399 --> 00:37:33,429
Oh,

754
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,320
they would.

755
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:38,709
Yeah, we'd go to the post office to pick them up and bring them home.

756
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:40,959
That's so funny that they just sent them in the mail.

757
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:42,639
I think they still send them in the mail.

758
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:44,830
Oh, I think they still do

759
00:37:45,209 --> 00:37:46,679
if that's what you want to do.

760
00:37:46,689 --> 00:37:51,479
But anyway, that was, that was impressive because we were city kids. And so

761
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:54,409
anything we got to do on the farm was like

762
00:37:54,729 --> 00:37:55,780
the best,

763
00:37:55,889 --> 00:37:57,000
I'm sure it was.

764
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:57,750
Huh?

765
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,860
That's so funny.

766
00:37:59,379 --> 00:38:03,510
Yeah. Going down to feed the pigs and, you know, and all the cousins.

767
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,439
They were used to all that because they were country kids.

768
00:38:06,929 --> 00:38:08,879
You big city folk from Granger,

769
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:13,600
like Bruce and Brand and Steven. Those kids were all country kids.

770
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:20,489
So, what did grandma Della make that you guys liked? Besides homemade mac and cheese

771
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,050
or? What was her trifle?

772
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:26,810
Yeah, it was kind of her famous. And

773
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,090
my dad liked rice pudding. So she made,

774
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:34,350
she made that rice pudding, the really easy one it seems like all the time.

775
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,610
Yeah.

776
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,439
And I'm trying to think

777
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:43,500
what else? Oh, meat loaf was huge at our house. Oh, really?

778
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:47,060
Dad loved meat loaf. That was one of his favorite things.

779
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:49,399
So mom made it pro, I bet we had it.

780
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,879
I don't know. Once a week.

781
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:52,669
Oh.

782
00:38:53,909 --> 00:38:54,840
What about,

783
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:00,830
were you guys ever scared of grandma? Was she ever the disciplinarian or?

784
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,020
Could you get away with anything with grandma?

785
00:39:07,419 --> 00:39:09,570
So, you, were you afraid of grandpa?

786
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:11,189
Was he scary?

787
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,060
I was never afraid of him

788
00:39:13,409 --> 00:39:16,260
but you didn't really ever do? I was a good kid.

789
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:19,760
I did not do anything wrong until I had to get married.

790
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:23,330
That was the biggest mistake I ever made. That was your first mistake, huh?

791
00:39:23,389 --> 00:39:26,419
That was pretty much the first mistake other than

792
00:39:26,649 --> 00:39:32,070
I called Julie a bitch one day as I'm coming down the stairs and grandpa

793
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:36,159
said, if I ever said that word again.

794
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,070
Yeah, I would be,

795
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:40,760
I would be grounded.

796
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,010
So, those are your two mistakes.

797
00:39:43,989 --> 00:39:44,699
How did they,

798
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,060
how did they react when you told them you were pregnant?

799
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,070
Um,

800
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,540
they were nice. I mean, what could they say?

801
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,409
Well, I mean,

802
00:39:56,989 --> 00:40:01,540
and some people aren't nice. Some people say you're out of our family.

803
00:40:01,669 --> 00:40:06,469
No, they were nice. They were, then we're gonna, you guys have got to get married.

804
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:08,139
Then if you're gonna get married,

805
00:40:08,149 --> 00:40:10,060
you guys need to get married and we

806
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,780
just planned the wedding that happened in January and

807
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,800
we got married March 11th.

808
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:22,479
But I don't feel like they were ever really judgmental of people. They just were like

809
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,860
they were not because

810
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:29,159
Aunt Brenda's daughter, Carol got married and had to get married and

811
00:40:29,449 --> 00:40:32,360
they let them have the wedding at our house

812
00:40:32,729 --> 00:40:33,360
and

813
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:37,179
her, her husband was a dip shit

814
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:41,550
and she only stayed married to him a little like barely

815
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:42,770
and

816
00:40:42,939 --> 00:40:45,050
they never were judgy ever.

817
00:40:45,379 --> 00:40:47,050
They were always kind,

818
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:50,370
they always did whatever they could to help anybody.

819
00:40:50,669 --> 00:40:53,010
That's how they were. And I think that's why

820
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,409
when they passed away.

821
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,300
I mean, really, I couldn't believe the number of people

822
00:40:59,060 --> 00:40:59,459
that came.

823
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,139
Now there were a ton of people

824
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:02,870
and

825
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,580
oh, we love your mom and dad. And I mean, people just said that over and over. So

826
00:41:09,129 --> 00:41:11,979
because when I think about them as a couple,

827
00:41:11,989 --> 00:41:16,070
I always think how they were always so kind and

828
00:41:16,439 --> 00:41:19,300
unconditional when they came to loving people

829
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,260
and that whoever came into their house,

830
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,580
they made you feel like you were so important.

831
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,360
I know. And they were nice. Remember Leslie's husband? Her act was nice

832
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,800
to everyone. They were nice.

833
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,899
They were nice to him and he,

834
00:41:32,909 --> 00:41:36,500
he came and helped them several times and cleaned their furniture and,

835
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:37,780
and

836
00:41:38,979 --> 00:41:39,610
you know,

837
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:43,939
people would want to reciprocate for them because they were so nice because I think

838
00:41:44,399 --> 00:41:44,820
they were,

839
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,699
I can't remember anybody other than Adeline's husband who dad didn't like.

840
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:55,580
He, he liked everyone. He, I don't remember him ever

841
00:41:56,419 --> 00:41:58,840
saying a negative thing about anyone

842
00:41:59,229 --> 00:42:01,199
and grandma would gossip now and then.

843
00:42:01,209 --> 00:42:04,350
But I mean, that was just her, but when it came down to it,

844
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,439
I felt like whoever came into their house,

845
00:42:06,449 --> 00:42:10,159
they always made them feel like you were so special

846
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:13,500
and they were so glad you were there and they were always like

847
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:18,760
welcoming of everyone. Like when even my friends know who they are.

848
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:23,030
Like, Tatum still knows who grandma Dela is and how she was and

849
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:24,379
people

850
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:25,590
that

851
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:26,010
says a

852
00:42:26,139 --> 00:42:28,350
lot about, about them.

853
00:42:28,669 --> 00:42:30,689
Well, and I think also for me,

854
00:42:30,699 --> 00:42:33,280
like when it comes to people that aren't members of the

855
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:36,669
church or they're choosing not to participate in the church,

856
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:42,909
grandma and grandpa never in my eyes showed any favoritism depending on

857
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,350
if you were active or not.

858
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:47,979
Like they always made you feel like

859
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:53,429
you were number one. And I think like all the grandkids individually thought like

860
00:42:54,169 --> 00:42:54,729
they were

861
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:57,340
one regardless of

862
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:59,350
your life choices.

863
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,649
And I don't think a lot of people are good at that.

864
00:43:03,419 --> 00:43:05,590
Well, they were good at that with J

865
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:06,790
and he,

866
00:43:07,139 --> 00:43:07,959
he just,

867
00:43:08,479 --> 00:43:08,610
but

868
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:08,780
I

869
00:43:08,929 --> 00:43:08,969
think,

870
00:43:09,979 --> 00:43:12,020
but they would just remind him or,

871
00:43:12,939 --> 00:43:14,590
I don't know, I, I

872
00:43:14,939 --> 00:43:16,189
think you have to,

873
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:22,050
I think he felt like they didn't love him but they did love him. I think gene is

874
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,449
overly sensitive and insecure.

875
00:43:25,149 --> 00:43:27,780
I don't think it came from, I don't think that came

876
00:43:27,889 --> 00:43:30,050
from them. I think that comes from him.

877
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:31,139
Yeah,

878
00:43:31,669 --> 00:43:32,719
just after

879
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,649
going on that cruise.

880
00:43:34,659 --> 00:43:38,090
Like I haven't been around your siblings for that much time ever

881
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:39,729
since I was a child.

882
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:44,629
So now being an as being an adult and spending that much time with them

883
00:43:44,949 --> 00:43:47,320
and seeing how they interact with each other

884
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:50,149
and as adult siblings,

885
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,909
like you can see

886
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,389
how insecure jean is.

887
00:43:56,219 --> 00:43:56,360
And it's

888
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:00,540
sad because I'm like he's married to Lorraine is so good to him.

889
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:01,550
Like I can't believe Lorraine

890
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:02,040
is

891
00:44:02,219 --> 00:44:02,239
so

892
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:02,750
good

893
00:44:02,969 --> 00:44:04,679
and married to him. He's so honoring

894
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:08,739
and his kids all think he's

895
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:11,620
the best thing on the planet. So I'm like,

896
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:15,250
you need to let go of what insecurity you have from

897
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:17,379
whenever it was growing up and,

898
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:20,100
and maybe they made him feel bad when he

899
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:22,340
made some dumb choices and didn't go to church.

900
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:22,939
But like,

901
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:26,939
I don't think Lindsay would ever say grandma treated me differently.

902
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,100
I don't think she would either.

903
00:44:30,149 --> 00:44:33,330
I think they all felt loved and accepted.

904
00:44:34,629 --> 00:44:36,469
I think Gene,

905
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,409
you know, they went through the temple and he had a calling and

906
00:44:41,689 --> 00:44:43,889
they were happy in that ward and I

907
00:44:43,899 --> 00:44:47,219
think somebody said something that hurt Gene's feelings.

908
00:44:47,229 --> 00:44:47,649
And

909
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:49,969
from then on, it was like

910
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:50,850
he,

911
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:54,679
he didn't say enough bad about the church, but he's such a good guy.

912
00:44:54,810 --> 00:45:01,040
He is a really nice guy as far as taking care of his friends. He's really loyal.

913
00:45:01,229 --> 00:45:03,850
You know what? I know he has a lot of really good qualities.

914
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:07,080
I just think there's this insecurity that makes him

915
00:45:07,919 --> 00:45:10,929
when he feels hurt or offended, he immediately

916
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:14,830
puts up these walls and becomes angry and doesn't let go.

917
00:45:15,729 --> 00:45:18,239
Which is sad because he is such a good person.

918
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,639
But I I from my perspective as a kid,

919
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:25,199
I always saw grandma and grandpa welcome everyone in

920
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,639
and made everyone feel

921
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:33,229
like they were so important. Like you have value as a human being.

922
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,520
No. And people would always go and drop in.

923
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:38,389
I mean, like there's

924
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:42,899
nieces and nephews like Carol loved Grandpa,

925
00:45:43,179 --> 00:45:44,370
Carol, uh,

926
00:45:44,889 --> 00:45:45,399
Sonson

927
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:51,070
and a lot of those nieces and nephews just loved him and mom to death.

928
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:54,169
So they would come and just drop in and see him all the time.

929
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:56,840
Yeah, they would just drop in and say hi and

930
00:45:57,169 --> 00:45:58,129
stuff like that.

931
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:02,110
I used to do that when I was like a teenager

932
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:02,989
or

933
00:46:03,149 --> 00:46:03,159
a

934
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,310
young adult

935
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:08,439
because they always made you feel like you're the best person ever.

936
00:46:09,139 --> 00:46:12,729
I know they are. They were, they were just good people.

937
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:18,120
Ok. I gotta look and see if there's any other questions that are really?

938
00:46:21,169 --> 00:46:22,689
What were, well, I was,

939
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,530
did they have any talents

940
00:46:33,669 --> 00:46:34,929
that you're aware of?

941
00:46:35,419 --> 00:46:38,689
Like grandpa was athletic? Wasn't he like naturally an athlete?

942
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:45,290
Grandpa was naturally athletic and he was so cute when he was young. He was so cute.

943
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:46,050
He was,

944
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:51,280
and he played basketball, he played football, he played tennis

945
00:46:52,219 --> 00:46:53,639
and he played it well,

946
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,939
grandma was a cheerleader, period.

947
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,100
Well,

948
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,209
but like no musical ability in the family.

949
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:05,320
No, no musical ability in the family.

950
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:06,580
I

951
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,489
think that's why they wanted us all to play the piano

952
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:12,169
or something that someone would.

953
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,850
Well, because you guys did have a piano.

954
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,320
You can play the saxophone.

955
00:47:17,939 --> 00:47:18,610
Oh, he can,

956
00:47:19,159 --> 00:47:20,340
I think he can.

957
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:23,969
All right. I'm trying to think if there's something else.

958
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:28,699
Ok. I have to run in the bathroom really quick and I'll be right.

959
00:47:28,739 --> 00:47:30,429
Well, you know what I can go,

960
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:32,149
I'll let you go. Are you sure?

961
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:34,870
Yeah. No, this was really great. This was helpful.

962
00:47:36,709 --> 00:47:36,889
It was

963
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:37,149
fun.

964
00:47:37,959 --> 00:47:41,750
I'm going to do this again, but I'm going to ask you more stuff about like you and dad.

965
00:47:42,469 --> 00:47:43,969
Ok. That's fine.

966
00:47:44,379 --> 00:47:48,989
I, um, I went to the doctor today about that little bladder thing.

967
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:50,159
Um,

968
00:47:50,629 --> 00:47:56,219
I have to go get AC A T scan with contrast and if, if that,

969
00:47:56,229 --> 00:48:01,389
if that thing shows up then I have to have surgery on it in two weeks.

970
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:02,500
So,

971
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:03,469
well,

972
00:48:03,479 --> 00:48:08,449
they just have to go in and they go up through your bladder and he said they scrape it.

973
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:11,169
And so is it tiny?

974
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:14,409
I don't know how tiny it is.

975
00:48:15,139 --> 00:48:15,879
So,

976
00:48:16,179 --> 00:48:18,419
are you doing that in Wyoming? The,

977
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,800
the cat scan? Oh, ok. Yeah,

978
00:48:21,479 --> 00:48:25,159
I'm doing the cat scan. They've got to call me from the hospital and then

979
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:30,280
he'll do the surgery up here because he comes here every other week.

980
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:34,439
So, just when he's here next time you'll go do that.

981
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:34,939
Yeah.

982
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:37,860
And he said if it doesn't show up on the cat scan,

983
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:41,379
then he said they'll cancel the surgery and it's not a big deal.

984
00:48:41,449 --> 00:48:42,959
So, when are you doing your cat scan?

985
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
They have to call me from the hospital and let me know.

986
00:48:47,449 --> 00:48:49,290
And then when are you coming for Avery?

987
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:54,649
I'm coming for Avery. Probably Saturday morning.

988
00:48:55,129 --> 00:48:55,889
Ok.

989
00:48:56,899 --> 00:48:57,639
And

990
00:48:57,909 --> 00:49:02,239
I don't know, I might come Friday. I don't know if Remick is gonna be here or not.

991
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,439
So,

992
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:05,100
and then

993
00:49:05,959 --> 00:49:07,020
what was my other question?

994
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:09,500
Oh, we want to do, Ashley and I were talking,

995
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:12,260
we think we should do like a zoom call with everyone

996
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:14,580
to plan our

997
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:16,050
island park trip.

998
00:49:16,229 --> 00:49:18,340
But we'll wait and do it. Like after

999
00:49:18,659 --> 00:49:20,020
everything's done with Avery,

1000
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:23,620
we'll just plan a like maybe on a Sunday evening to everyone,

1001
00:49:23,629 --> 00:49:25,979
get on and do a zoom call and then plan the trip.

1002
00:49:25,989 --> 00:49:30,439
No, I, I think we need to do that for sure. So we know what we're bringing, what we're

1003
00:49:30,649 --> 00:49:34,159
and you know, the bedrooms. I think we should have all that decided.

1004
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:37,540
No, I think we should decide the bedrooms, the food and then

1005
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,469
what we're doing each day.

1006
00:49:40,879 --> 00:49:41,409
So,

1007
00:49:41,709 --> 00:49:41,850
no, I

1008
00:49:41,959 --> 00:49:43,290
agree. And then

1009
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,560
so we'll do that in a couple more Sundays.

1010
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:50,909
We'll talk about that at Avery's Farewell when we want to do the zoom call.

1011
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:51,989
Ok,

1012
00:49:52,219 --> 00:49:52,320
that

1013
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:52,709
sounds

1014
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:53,340
good.

1015
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:53,979
That

1016
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:58,159
sounds good. Ok. Well, thanks for talking to me. Let me know when you do your cat scan?

1017
00:49:58,780 --> 00:49:59,870
All right, I will

1018
00:50:00,399 --> 00:50:02,709
love you dear. Thank you. See you later.

1019
00:50:02,959 --> 00:50:03,659
Bye.
